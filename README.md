#  Road Accident Analysis in the UK from (2021 - 2022)



##  Project Overview

In this Project we created a Road accident dashboard For the year 2021 and 2022 in order to have insight on the important requirements such as Monthly Trend Showing Comparison of casualties for 2021 and 2022,	Total Caualties and total accident by location etc. Causes of accident solution was provided on how to mitigate further Road Accident.

Tools used: **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI**

##  What each Tools was used for

- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing    
- **Power BI** â€“ Advance Cleaning, data visualization and Dashboard development

##  Analytical Tasks


###  Excel Data Cleaning

- Cleaned and structured raw data
- Correctly formatted columns in the data such as dates, text, and numbers
- Handled inconsistencies and missing values
- Created pivot tables for initial glance into the analysis.

---

###  Power BI Dashboard

Built a dynamic dashboard to visually present:

- Trend of road accidents (2020â€“2024)
- States with highest fatalities and injuries
- Accident causes comparison across years and quarters
- Speed violation, fatigue, and mechanical issues breakdown
- KPI cards and filters for interactive analysis

##  Key Insights

- **Car** were involved in by far the most casualties (155,804).
- **Total casualties**  dropped from 222K in 2021 to 195.7K in 2022, a 11.9% decrease.
- **Monthly trend** Casualties in 2022 consistently stayed below 2021 levels, showing improved road safety throughout the year
- **Casualties by Area Type** Urban areas recorded 61.95% of casualties, while rural areas had 38.05%.
- **Casualties by Location** The UK map shows a high concentration of accidents in major urban areas, especially around:
  - London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Belfast

## âœ… Recommendations

- Introduce **traffic calming measures** such as speed bumps and better signage on these roads especially on the single carriage ways which contributed to the majority of accidents.
- Enhance **Urban Road Safety** such as Improving pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, and speed control zones in dense areas.
- Reduce **Car-Related Casualties** by Launching targeted driver awareness campaigns focusing on seatbelt use, phone distractions, and speed limits.
- Improve Daytime Traffic Management i.e Reinforce road safety during peak hours (morning & evening commutes)and also Explore staggered work hours or public transport incentives to reduce road congestion.
- Encourage **More Data Collection** by Implement smart sensors, IoT devices, and real-time data integration for predictive accident analysis.
- Invest in Safer Infrastructure in High-Incidence Locations because Accident hotspots are highly concentrated in urban centers like London, Manchester, Birmingham, therefoe Use this data to prioritize funding for local road improvements, better signage, lighting, and roundabout redesigns in these cities.
