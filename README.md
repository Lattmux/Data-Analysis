#  Road Accident Analysis in the UK from (2021 - 2022)



##  Project Overview

In this Project we created a Road accident dashboard For the year 2021 and 2022 in order to have insight on the important requirements such as Monthly Trend Showing Comparison of casualties for 2021 and 2022,	Total Caualties and total accident by location etc. Causes of accident solution was provided on how to mitigate further Road Accident.

Tools used: **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI**

---

##  What each Tools was used for

- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing    
- **Power BI** â€“ Advance Cleaning, data visualization and Dashboard development 

---

##  Analytical Tasks


###  Excel Data Cleaning

- Cleaned and structured raw data
- Correctly formatted columns in the data such as dates, text, and numbers
- Handled inconsistencies and missing values
- Created pivot tables for initial glance into the analysis.

###  Power BI Dashboard

Built a dynamic dashboard to visually present:

- Trend of road accidents (2020â€“2024)
- States with highest fatalities and injuries
- Accident causes comparison across years and quarters
- Speed violation, fatigue, and mechanical issues breakdown
- KPI cards and filters for interactive analysis

 **Power BI File**: [`)

##  Key Insights

- **Speed Violation** was the leading cause of road accidents.
- **Q2 2023** recorded the highest number of casualties.
